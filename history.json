The lack of system details, sender information, and the use of a URL shortening service raise immediate security concerns.\n\nI must formally request that you verify the authenticity of this access issue through our established internal IT Security Help Desk or an official, known internal email address before I can take any action on the link provided.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this verification request.\n\nSincerely,\n[Finance Employee Name]",

Is it a special bonus, or maybe a company contest I forgot about? \n\nAlso, I see where it says 'Click the link below,' but I don't actually see the link itself in the email body. I definitely want to click it before the 24 hours are up, so could you please quickly resend the email and make sure the link is visible? I don't want to miss this generous offer!\n\nThank you for the clarification and the help!\n\nSincerely,",
